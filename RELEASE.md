# Lodestar Release Guidelines

Lodestar is blockchain node securing the Ethereum Beacon chain network. It is run by external individuals and operator entities outside of the control of the Lodestar team. We, as most other core dev teams, choose a slow conservative approach to releasing to ensure that node runners always update to stable, safe and performant versions of our software.

Lodestar uses a modified version of gitflow to manage releases. Gitflow is a well-known strategy that suits our needs for security and stability.

## Stable release

### When to a release

Lodestar does not have a fixed schedule for releases. Instead, they are published as the developers see fit.

The causes for a release are varied, however here are several common ones:

- To include a major bug-fix, optimisation or feature.
- To include a series of small changes which have shown to improve performance, usability, etc.
- If significant or risky PRs are waiting to merge and we wish to try and isolate those changes to a future release. I.e., to leave a "clean slate" for future PRs to apply to.

To start a new release, one of the Lodestar developers will communicate this via the Lodestar chat channel and seek consensus from the other developers.

### 1. Create release candidate

TODO: determine which steps may be automated and update these steps with best practices when available

manual steps (as example version `v1.1.0`, commit `9fceb02`):

- The team selects a commit from `unstable` as a "release candidate" for a new version release.
- Create a new release branch `rc/v1.1.0` at commit `9fceb02`.
  - `git checkout -b rc/v1.1.0 9fceb02`
- Set monorepo version to `v1.1.0-rc.0`.
  - `lerna version v1.1.0-rc.0 --no-git-tag-version --force-publish --yes`
- Commit changes
  - `git commit -am "v1.1.0-rc.0"`
- Tag resulting commit as `v1.1.0-rc.0` with an annotated tag, push branch and tag.
  - `git tag -am "v1.1.0-rc.0" v1.1.0-rc.0`
  - `git push --tag`
- Open draft PR from `rc/v1.1.0` to `stable` with title `v1.1.0 release`.

### 2. Test release candidate

Once a release candidate is created, the Lodestar team begins a 3 day testing period.

If there is a bug discovered during the testing period which significantly impacts performance, security or stability, and it is determined that it is no longer prudent to promote the `rc.x` candidate to `stable`, then it will await a bug fix by the team. The fix will be committed, may be back-ported to `unstable` and we publish and promote the new commit to `rc.x+1`. The 3 day testing period will reset.

For example: After 3-5 days of testing, is performance equal or better than latest stable?

- **Yes**: Continue to next release step
- **No**: If it a small issue fixable quickly (hot-fix)?
  - **Yes**: push a commit to branch `rc/v1.1.0` and re-start testing process with `v1.1.0-rc.1`.
  - **No**: abort the release. Close the `v1.1.0 release` PR, delete the branch, start the whole release process over.

### 3. Merge release candidate

TODO: determine which steps may be automated and update these steps with best practices when available

manual steps (as example version `v1.1.0`):

- Ensure step 2 testing is successful and there is sufficient consensus to release `v1.1.0`.
- Set monorepo version to `v1.1.0`.
  - `lerna version v1.1.0 --no-git-tag-version --force-publish --yes`
- Commit changes.
  - `git commit -am "v1.1.0"`
- Gather required PR approvals.
- Merge `v1.1.0 release` PR to stable **with "merge commit"** strategy to preserve all history.
- Tag resulting merge commit as `v1.1.0` with an annotated tag, push commit and tag.
  - `git tag -am "v1.1.0" v1.1.0`
  - `git push --tag`
- Open a PR to merge `stable` into `unstable` **with merge commit** strategy. This PR should be merged ASAP.
- Publish to Social Media

## Hot-fix release

If a stable version requires an immediate hot-fix before the next minor or major release:

manual steps (as example version `v1.1.1`):

- Create a release branch `rc/v1.1.1` from `stable`.
- Commit the hot-fix to the `rc/v1.1.1` branch.
- Adjusting to the urgency and severity of the fix, perform the above steps using this branch.
  1. Create a release candidate
  2. Test release candidate
  3. Merge release candidate

## Dev release

On every commit to `unstable` a dev release is done automatically in CI. A dev release:

- is not tagged
- does not have a release page
- is published to NPM
- is pushed to Dockerhub

The source code is mutated before release to set a version string of format `v1.1.0-dev.da9f72360`, where the appended hash is the merge commit hash to unstable that triggered this CI build. The semver version that prefixes is expected to be the next minor version from the current code. The target consumers of such versions are automatic testing environments and other developers. They are expected to install via `next` tags and refer to the whole version for debugging.

## Details

### Publishing a release

The publishing of stable releases and release candidates are triggered by pushing a tag.

CI ensures the validity of stable release and release candidates by checking:
  - the tag matches the version in source
  - for stable releases, the commit is latest in the `stable` branch

  This prevents accidentally publishing an incorrect version of Lodestar.

Dev releases are triggered on every new push to `unstable`.

Github workflows publish:

- to NPM registry
- to Dockerhub
- to Github releases

The behavior differs based on whether a stable release, a release candidate, or dev release is being performed.

- Stable release
  - published to npm with `latest` dist tag
  - published to docker with `latest` tag
  - a full github release is published
- Release candidate
  - published to npm with `rc` dist tag
  - published to docker with `rc` tag
  - a prerelease github release is published
- Dev release
  - published to npm with `next` dist tag
  - published to docker with `next` tag
  - no github release is published

### How to test release candidates

We test the pre-release candidate on multiple servers with a variety of connected validators on a stable testnet for a minimum of three (3) days.

The following observations must be taken into consideration before promoting the release candidate to `stable`:

- Are there any critical issues observed?
  - Examples: Memory leaks, abnormally high memory usage, abnormally high CPU performance, etc.
- Has profitability been affected?
  - Has profitability decreased and whether or not the variance is acceptable.
- Has any performance metric degraded comparably to the previous `stable` release? If yes, is the variance acceptable?
  - Example: Block processing times, validator miss ratios, etc.

### Edit the Release

Releases are published automatically via CI.

Any additional release notes should be professional, comprehensive and well considered.

Have someone else review the release notes and then edit the release.

### Publish to Social Media

The release should be announced on the following social channels:

- Email: with mailchimp.
- Discord: Use the #lodestar-announcements channel. Tag @everyone and ensure it is published to all downstream channels.
- Twitter: Short and sweet in a single tweet, TODO: get lodestar account.
- Reddit: TODO: get lodestar account.

## Alternatives considered

Historical context and reasons against valid alternatives to help future discussions

**Version branches**

Lodestar used `master` as the single target for feature branches.

![lodestar-release](docs/images/lodestar-releases.png)

- Main branch = `master`
- Features merged to `master`
- To trigger rc, branch from `master` to `v1.1.x`
- `master` had package.json preemptively updated to the "next" version
- QA is done on `v1.1.x` branch
- Fixes on rc are done on `v1.1.x`, then re-tag
- Once released final `v1.1.0` tag is on a branch that is never merged
- Hot-fixes are either cherry-picked from `master` or done on the `v1.1.x` branch, never merged

However this had some issues:

- Aborted releases left master in awkward version 2 minors ahead of stable. When triggering the release again, we had to rollback master
- Almost all release tags ended in branches not part of the master tree. This caused issues since it's not straightforward to compute the diff between commits that are not direct parents of each other

**Continuous integration**

Always releasing `master` is another popular approach used by some entities but unsuitable for Lodestar. Given the complexity of a blockchain node, it's not possible to guarantee stable performance unless running the software for days in special conditions, not available in regular CI environments.
