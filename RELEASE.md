# Lodestar Release Guidelines

## Release Process Rules

In the same day:

1. The team selects a commit from `master` as a "stable target" for a new version release. As example target next version is `v0.34.0`, commit `9fceb02`. Master package.json versions are already at `v0.34.0` to release nightly versions.
2. The selected commit is branched into a separate release branch (Example: `v0.34.x`)
3. The selected commit is tagged as `v0.34.0-beta.0`, released, and published for testing as a Pre-Release

```
export TAG=v0.34.0-beta.0 && git tag -a $TAG 9fceb02 -m "$TAG" && git push origin $TAG
```

4. The team creates a PR to bump `master` to the next version (in the example: `v0.35.0`) and continues releasing nightly builds.

```
lerna version minor --no-git-tag-version
```

After 3-5 days of testing:

5. Tag final stable commit as `v0.34.0`, release and publish the stable release. This commit will be in `v0.34.x` branch and may note be on `master` if beta candidate required bug fixes.

```
export TAG=v0.34.0 git && tag -a $TAG 9fceb02 -m "$TAG" && git push origin $TAG
```

## Pre-Releases

A `v.beta.x` release is published and tagged (Example: `v0.33.0-beta.0`) when the team selects a commit as a "stable target" candidate.

### Pre-Release Testing Checklist

We test the pre-release candidate on multiple servers with a variance of connected validators on a stable testnet for a minimum of three (3) days.

The following observations must be taken into consideration before promoting the pre-release candidate to a `:stable` release:

- Are there any critical issues observed?

  - Examples: Memory leaks, abnormally high memory usage, abnormally high CPU performance, etc.

- Has profitibility been affected?

  - Has profitability decreased and whether or not the variance is acceptable.

- Has any performance metric degraded comparably to the previous `stable` release? If yes, is the variance acceptable?
  - Example: Block processing times, validator miss ratios, etc.

### Bug fixes to Pre-Releases

If there is a bug discovered during the pre-release testing period which significantly impacts performance, security or stability, and it is determined that it is no longer prudent to release the `beta.x` candidate as `stable`, then it will await a bug fix by the team. The fix will be committed, back-ported to `master` and we publish and promote the new commit to `beta.x+1`. The 3 day testing period minimums will reset.

## Stable Releases

When the pre-release candidate (Example: `v0.33.0-beta.0`) has met the testing requirements, we execute `release.yml`. This script will promote & tag the candidate to the `stable` release track and remove `beta.x`, publishing the version as `v0.33.0`.

The CI will check and tag the new stable release, publish to the NPM Registry and to Docker Hub.

## Minor/Patch Releases

The `minor` is increased as soon as new smaller features do get introduced. A minor release will not affect any depending project. Such a release only introduces smaller enhancements and features. A `patch` release only contains required bug fixes with a low risk to impact depending project.
