// Reasoning of the API definitions
// ================================
//
// An HTTP request to the Lodestar BeaconNode API involves these steps regarding serialization:
// 1. Serialize request: api args => req params
//    --- wire
// 2. Deserialize request: req params => api args
//    --- exec api
// 3. Serialize api return => res body
//    --- wire
// 4. Deserialize res body => api return
//
// In our case we define the client in the exact same interface as the API executor layer.
// Therefore we only need to define how to translate args <-> request, and return <-> response.
//
// All files in the /routes directory provide succinct definitions to do those transformations plus:
// - URL + method, for each route ID
// - Runtime schema, for each route ID
//
// Almost all routes receive JSON and return JSON. So both the client and the server can be
// auto-generated from the definitions. Also, the design allows for customizability for the few
// routes that need non-JSON serialization (like debug.getState and lightclient.getProof)
//
// With this approach Typescript help us ensure that the client and server are compatible at build
// time, ensure there are tests for all routes and makes it very cheap to maintain and add new routes.
//
//
// How to add new routes
// =====================
//
// 1. Add the route function signature to the `Api` type. The function name MUST match the routeId from the spec.
//    The arguments should use spec types if appropriate. Non-spec types MUST be defined in before the Api type
//    so they are scoped by routes namespace. The all arguments MUST use camelCase casing.
// 2. Add URL + METHOD in `routesData` matching the spec.
// 3. Declare request serializers in `getReqSerializers()`. You MAY use `RouteReqTypeGenerator` to declare the
//    ReqTypes and request serializers in the same place.
// 4. Add the return type of the route to `getReturnTypes()` if it has any. The return type doesn't have to be
//    a full SSZ type, but just a TypeJson with allows to convert from struct -> json -> struct.
