Typescript imlementation of the Eth2.0 beacon chain

## What you need
You will need to go over the [specification](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs). You will also need to have a [basic understanding of sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-FAQs). Note that that the specification is an ongoing document and will get outdated. The reference implementation by the Ethereum development team is written in Python and can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain).

## Run dev

` ./bin/lodestar dev -v 8 -p minimal`

#### Using start-multi.sh

`sh ./start-multi.sh <number_of_beacon_nodes> <total_validators> <validator_distribution_per_node>`
`sh ./start-multi.sh 4 8 8,0,0,0`

#### Generating flame graphs from spec tests
Example of cpu-profile generation of blocksanity tests in current directory

`GEN_PROFILE_DIR=$PWD mocha -r ./.babel-register 'test/spec/sanity/blocks/blocksanity_s_mainnet.test.ts'`

To view results:
```bash
npm i -g 0x
0x --visualize-cpu-profile ./0\ -\ blocksanity-1561705313935.cpuprofile
```
Open resulting html file in favorite browser.

## Usage
1. If you haven't `yarn install`
2. `lerna run build`
3. `packages/lodestar/./bin/lodestar --help`

Note:

Spec test cases are optional dependency which can be skipped by adding `--ignore-optional` when installing dependencies.
You can always download spec test cases by running `yarn install --force`.

### Starting private eth1 chain

`./bin/lodestar eth1:dev -m "vast thought differ pull jewel broom cook wrist tribe word before omit"`

This will start ganache server on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`. For more configuration check `./bin/lodestar eth1:dev --help`

### Starting lodestar beacon chain

`./bin/lodestar beacon --db test-db --eth1RpcUrl http://127.0.0.1:8545 --depositContract <depositContractAddress>`

You will see deposit contract address in console if you used `./bin/lodestar eth1:dev`.

### Making validator deposit

`./bin/lodestar deposit -m "vast thought differ pull jewel broom cook wrist tribe word before omit" -n http://127.0.0.1:8545 -c <depositContractAddress>>`

This will trigger 10 deposits to deposit contract which will trigger beacon chain initialization. Make sure to use same mnemonic which you used to start eth1 network.
