# SSZ Views & Proofs

This guide covers **tree-backed views** and **proofs**, which are advanced SSZ features for performance and verifiability.  
If you’re new, start with the [SSZ Quickstart](./ssz-quickstart.md).

## Introduction to views and proofs
### What are Views in SSZ?  

Think of **views** as *live, Merkle-aware wrappers around SSZ data*.  

- When you call `defaultValue()`, you just get a **plain JavaScript object**.  
- When you call `defaultView()`, you get a **View**, which is:  
  - Backed by a **Merkle tree internally**  
  - Lets you **read/write fields like a normal object**, but keeps the underlying tree updated  
  - Supports **fast hashing, partial updates, and proof creation**  

In simple terms:  
**Views are SSZ objects wrapped with an internal Merkle tree.**  
They behave like normal objects, but every change you make is tracked in the tree, making hashing and proofs efficient.

### Why Views?  

- Regular SSZ objects (`defaultValue()`) are just simple JS objects.  
- Views (`defaultView()`) give you an *optimized Merkle tree representation* that allows:  
  1. Partial updates  
  2. Efficient hashing  
  3. Creating and consuming proofs  

 **Analogy:**  
A View is like a **live SSZ object plugged into its Merkle tree**. You don’t have to rebuild the tree every time — it stays updated as you edit the object.
