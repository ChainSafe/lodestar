   *
   * ## Note
   *
   * This function will potentially send *two* notifications to the `BlockService`; it will send a
   * notification initially, then it will download the latest duties and send a *second* notification
   * if those duties have changed. This behaviour simultaneously achieves the following:
   *
   * 1. Block production can happen immediately and does not have to wait for the proposer duties to
   *    download.
   * 2. We won't miss a block if the duties for the current slot happen to change with this poll.
   *
   * This sounds great, but is it safe? Firstly, the additional notification will only contain block
   * producers that were not included in the first notification. This should be safety enough.
   * However, we also have the slashing protection as a second line of defence. These two factors
   * provide an acceptable level of safety.
   *
   * It's important to note that since there is a 0-epoch look-ahead (i.e., no look-ahead) for block
   * proposers then it's very likely that a proposal for the first slot of the epoch will need go
   * through the slow path every time. I.e., the proposal will only happen after we've been able to
   * download and process the duties from the BN. This means it is very important to ensure this
   * function is as fast as possible.
