 * A pool of `Attestation` that is specially designed to store "unaggregated" attestations from
 * the native aggregation scheme.
 *
 * **The `NaiveAggregationPool` does not do any signature or attestation verification. It assumes
 * that all `Attestation` objects provided are valid.**
 *
 * ## Details
 *
 * The pool sorts the `Attestation` by `attestation.data.slot`, then by `attestation.data`.
 *
 * As each unaggregated attestation is added it is aggregated with any existing `attestation` with
 * the same `AttestationData`. Considering that the pool only accepts attestations with a single
 * signature, there should only ever be a single aggregated `Attestation` for any given
 * `AttestationData`.
 *
 * The pool has a capacity for `SLOTS_RETAINED` slots, when a new `attestation.data.slot` is
 * provided, the oldest slot is dropped and replaced with the new slot. The pool can also be
 * pruned by supplying a `current_slot`; all existing attestations with a slot lower than
 * `current_slot - SLOTS_RETAINED` will be removed and any future attestation with a slot lower
 * than that will also be refused. Pruning is done automatically based upon the attestations it
 * receives and it can be triggered manually.
