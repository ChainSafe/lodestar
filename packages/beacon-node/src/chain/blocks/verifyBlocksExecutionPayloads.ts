  // For a block with SYNCING status (called optimistic block), it's okay to import with
  // SYNCING status as EL could switch into syncing
  //
  // 1. On intial startup/restart
  // 2. When some reorg might have occured and EL doesn't has a parent root
  //    (observed on devnets)
  // 3. Because of some unavailable (and potentially invalid) root but there is no way
  //    of knowing if this is invalid/unavailable. For unavailable block, some proposer
  //    will (sooner or later) build on the available parent head which will
  //    eventually win in fork-choice as other validators vote on VALID blocks.
  //
  // Once EL catches up again and respond VALID, the fork choice will be updated which
  // will either validate or prune invalid blocks
  //
  // We need to track and keep updating if its safe to optimistically import these blocks.
  // The following is how we determine for a block if its safe:
  //
  // (but we need to modify this check for this segment of blocks because it checks if the
  //  parent of any block imported in forkchoice is post-merge and currently we could only
  //  have blocks[0]'s parent imported in the chain as this is no longer one by one verify +
  //  import.)
  //
  //
  // When to import such blocks:
  // From: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/2844
  // A block MUST NOT be optimistically imported, unless either of the following
  // conditions are met:
  //
  // 1. Parent of the block has execution
  //
  //     Since with the sync optimizations, the previous block might not have been in the
  //     forkChoice yet, so the below check could fail for safeSlotsToImportOptimistically
  //
  //     Luckily, we can depend on the preState0 to see if we are already post merge w.r.t
  //     the blocks we are importing.
  //
  //     Or in other words if
  //       - block status is syncing
  //       - and we are not in a post merge world and is parent is not optimistically safe
  //       - and we are syncing close to the chain head i.e. clock slot
  //       - and parent is optimistically safe
  //
  //      then throw error
  //
  //
  //       - if we haven't yet imported a post merge ancestor in forkchoice i.e.
  //       - and we are syncing close to the clockSlot, i.e. merge Transition could be underway
  //
  //
  // 2. The current slot (as per the system clock) is at least
  //    SAFE_SLOTS_TO_IMPORT_OPTIMISTICALLY ahead of the slot of the block being
  //    imported.
  //    This means that the merge transition could be underway and we can't afford to import
  //    a block which is not fully validated as it could affect liveliness of the network.
  //
  //
  // For this segment of blocks:
  //   We are optimistically safe with respec to this entire block segment if:
  //    - all the blocks are way behind the current slot
  //    - or we have already imported a post-merge parent of first block of this chain in forkchoice
