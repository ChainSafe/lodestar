Once you get the hang of it you will feel like you have super powers. It will up your game to a whole new level because you will be able to debug issues that seemed impossible before. Post-crash analysis is a very powerful tool to have in your tool belt.

While it is possible to run Lodestar in a number of ways, for performance profiling it is recommended to not use Dockerized implementations. It is best to run Lodestar as a service on a Linux machine. Follow the Lodestar docs to get the service installed and running. Then come back here when you are ready to generate the flamegraph.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contribution/tools/heap-dumps":{"id":"contribution/tools/heap-dumps","title":"Heap Dumps","description":"There are a number of reason why one would want to do a heap dump but in particular, they are helpful for find memory intensive operations and leaks. There are two major types of heap dumps that are available to node developers. The first is a JavaScript heap dump, and the second is a native heap dump. The JS heap dump is much more common and is the default heap dump that is generated by node. It is useful when analyzing JS generated objects that are managed by the runtime. However there is one major limitation to the JS heap dump, and that is that it does not include native objects. This is where the native heap dump comes in handy. The native heap dump is a snapshot of the entire process memory, and includes objects that are allocated by C/C++ code, including native modules in use by the application. The limitation to the native heap dump is that it will not include any JS objects that are allocated by the V8 runtime. Those are generally created within mmap\'ed pages and the native heap dump tools are specific to C objects that are created with malloc and destroyed via free. C++ is also covered as new and delete are wrappers around malloc and free. This is why it is important to understand how to analyze both types of memory usage.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"contribution/tools/perf":{"id":"contribution/tools/perf","title":"perf","description":""},"faqs":{"id":"faqs","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","description":"This section of the documentation will cover common questions and encounters often asked by users and developers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Home","description":"lodestar logo","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Ethereum is one of the most profoundly important inventions in recent history. It is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin, and is the most actively used blockchain. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015, with 72 million coins premined. ChainSafe was founded not too long afterwards and has been actively working in the Ethereum space ever since. We are proud to develop Lodestar and to present this documentation as a resource for the Ethereum community.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"libraries/api/using-the-api":{"id":"libraries/api/using-the-api","title":"using-the-api","description":""},"libraries/lightclient-prover/lightclient":{"id":"libraries/lightclient-prover/lightclient","title":"Lodestar Light Client","description":"Ethereum light clients provide a pathway for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain in a trust-minimized manner, comparable to the level of trust required when engaging with a third-party provider like Infura or EtherScan. Not that those platforms are bad, but trust in any centralized provider goes against the ethos of blockchain.

Both need to hold data for a full node to work correctly. In particular the execution node holds state such as wallet information and smart contract code. It also holds the execution blocks with the transaction record. The beacon node is responsible for holding beacon node blocks and state. The beacon state is responsible primarily for the validator information.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"run/beacon-management/mev-and-builder-integration":{"id":"run/beacon-management/mev-and-builder-integration","title":"MEV and Builder Integration","description":"MEV is a term that refers to the bundling of transactions in one particular order to extract (mostly) arbitrage opportunities on the dApps and decentralized exchanges.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"run/beacon-management/networking":{"id":"run/beacon-management/networking","title":"Networking","description":"Lodestar will automatically connect to peers on the network.
