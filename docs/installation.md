[TOC]

## Install from source

Make sure to have [Yarn installed](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). It is also recommended to [install NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and use the latest LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    NodeJS versions < 12 are not supported by Lodestar.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Clone the repo locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chainsafe/lodestar.git
```

Install across all packages. Lodestar follows a [monorepo](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) structure, so all commands below must be run in the project root. Use the `--ignore-optional` flag to prevent downloading the eth2 spec tests.

```bash
yarn install --ignore-optional
```

Build across all packages

```bash
yarn run build
```

Or if you are using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/):

```bash
lerna bootstrap
```

Lodestar should now be ready for use:

```bash
./lodestar --help
```

## Install from NPM

Install globally

```
npm install -g @chainsafe/lodestar-cli
```

or

```
yarn global add @chainsafe/lodestar-cli
```

Lodestar should now be ready to use:

```
lodestar --help
```

## Install with docker

The [`chainsafe/lodestar`](https://hub.docker.com/r/chainsafe/lodestar) Docker Hub repository is mantained actively. It contains the `lodestar` CLI preinstalled.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    The Docker Hub image in run on CI every nightly release on `master`
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Ensure you have Docker installed by issuing the command:
