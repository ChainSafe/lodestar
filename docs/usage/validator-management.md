# Validator management

The following instructions are required for stakers utilizing Lodestar.

[TOC]

## Wallet configuration

A wallet helps to manage many validators from a group of 12/24 words (also known as a "mnemonic" or "recovery phrase"). All validators and withdrawal keys can be re-generated from a backed-up mnemonic.

The mnemonic is randomly generated during wallet creation and printed out to the terminal. It's important to make one or more backups of the mnemonic to ensure your ETH wallets are not lost in the case of data loss.

!!! danger
    It is very important to keep your mnemonic private as it represents the ultimate control of your ETH wallets.

### Create a wallet

Lodestar is deprecating its functionality to create wallets.

To create a wallet, we recommend using the official [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases) from the Ethereum Foundation for users comfortable with command line interfaces.

Alternatively, for a graphical user interface, you can use the [Stakehouse Wagyu Key Generator](https://wagyu.gg/) developed by members of the EthStaker community.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    These tools will generate files for staking validators as well as the important mnemonic. This mnemonic must be handled and stored securely.

## Setup your validator

Validators are represented by a BLS keypair. Use your generated mnemonic from one of the tools above to generate the keystore files required for validator duties on Lodestar. 

### Import a validator keystore from your wallet to Lodestar

To import a validator keystore that was created via one of the methods described above, you must locate the validator keystore JSONs exported by those tools (ex. `keystore-m_12381_3600_0_0_0-1654128694.json`).

Inside the keystore JSON file, you should have an [EIP-2335 conformant keystore file](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2335.md#json-schema) such as the example below:

```
{
  "crypto": {
    "kdf": {
      "function": "scrypt",
      "params": {
        "dklen": 32,
        "n": 262144,
        "r": 8,
        "p": 1,
        "salt": "30bb9ef21d9f1f946c3c7ab70e27f453180a49d473a2a3e79ca2bc715ac4e898"
      },
      "message": ""
    },
    "checksum": {
      "function": "sha256",
      "params": {},
      "message": "ba3cf1c8ba5be4f90c36bcf44ee37a779eac8c54b72121e4755b6722e95164a7"
    },
    "cipher": {
      "function": "aes-128-ctr",
      "params": {
        "iv": "90f76d9d4d1b089e89802eac2f80b6b7"
      },
      "message": "8de2b0f55da54719822db6c083f0436ff94cd638be96c57b91339b438e9355f6"
    }
  },
  "description": "",
  "pubkey": "b22690ca679edd5fb9c2545f358da1427b8310e8ccf9e7e4f01ddce9b1d711a0362d35225673cce8f33911a22ae1519e",
  "path": "m/12381/3600/0/0/0",
  "uuid": "de83e8dc-8f95-4ea0-b9ba-cfa608ff3483",
  "version": 4
}
```

These keystore files should be placed into your `./keystores` folder in your Lodestar directory. 

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! info
    The `./keystores` folder is the default directory for storing validator keystores. You can specify a custom path using the `--keystoresDir /path/to/folder` flag. Reference our [validator command line](https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/reference/cli/#validator) for more information.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Create a `password.txt` file with the password you set for your keystores and save it into your `./secrets` folder in your Lodestar directory.

### Configuring the fee recipient address

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! warning
    This feature is in review. Please use with caution and report any issues to the team through our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yjyvFRP).
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Post-Merge Ethereum requires validators to set a **Fee Recipient** which allows you to receive priority fees when proposing blocks. If you do not set this address, your priority fees will be sent to the [burn address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).

Configure your validator client's fee recipient address by using the `--defaultFeeRecipient` flag. Ensure you specify an Ethereum address you control. An example of a fee recipient set with the address `0xB7576e9d314Df41EC5506494293Afb1bd5D3f65d` would add the following flag to their configuration: `--defaultFeeRecipient 0xB7576e9d314Df41EC5506494293Afb1bd5D3f65d`.

You may choose to use the `--strictFeeRecipientCheck` flag to enable a strict check of the fee recipient address with the one returned by the beacon node for added reassurance.

### Submit a validator deposit

DEPRECATED. Please use the official tools to perform your deposits - `staking-deposit-cli`: https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli - Ethereum Foundation launchpad: https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/

## Run the validator

To start a Lodestar validator run the command:

```bash
./lodestar validator --network $NETWORK_NAME
```

You should see confirmation that modules have started.

```bash
