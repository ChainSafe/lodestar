# Beacon management

The following instructions are required to setup and run a Lodestar beacon node.

[TOC]

## Connect to mainnet or a public testnet

Running a Lodestar node on mainnet or a testnet only requires basic familiarity with the terminal.

Make sure Lodestar is installed in your local environment, following the chosen install method. The following command should return a non error message.

```bash
./lodestar --help
```

For a complete list of beacon node CLI commands and options, see the [Command Line Reference](../../reference/cli/)

To select a known testnet or mainnet, use the `--network` flag. `mainnet` is selected by default, and a list of available networks is listed with the `--help` flag. Setting the `--network` flag will conveniently configure the beacon node or validator client for the selected network. For power users, any configuration option should be able to be overridden.

## Configure the Lodestar JWT authentication token

Post-Merge Ethereum will require [secure authentication with the Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/main/src/engine/authentication.md) connection on your chosen Execution node.

!!! info
    Post-Merge Ethereum **requires** a secure, authenticated connection to the Execution client on port 8551. We recommend setting this up now to ensure a proper configuration before the Merge.

### Generate a secret key

You must generate a secret 32-byte (64 characters) hexadecimal string that will be used to authenticate with an execution node. You can use the following command in most terminals to generate a random secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`. Or you can use an [online generator](https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-hexadecimal-numbers).  Save this secret key into a text file and note where you store this file.

### Configure Lodestar to locate the JWT secret

When starting up a Lodestar beacon node in any configuration, ensure you add the `--jwt-secret /path/to/file` flag to point to the saved secret key file. 

### Ensure JWT is configured with your execution node

**For Go Ethereum:**
Use the `--authrpc.jwtsecret /data/jwtsecret` flag to configure the secret. Use their documentation [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/merge).

**For Nethermind:**
Use the `--JsonRpc.JwtSecretFile /data/jwtsecret` flag to configure the secret. Use their documentation [here](https://docs.nethermind.io/nethermind/first-steps-with-nethermind/running-nethermind-post-merge#jwtsecretfile).

**For Besu:**
Use the `--engine-jwt-secret=<FILE>` flag to configure the secret. Use their documentation [here](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax/#engine-jwt-secret).

**For Erigon:**
Use the `--authrpc.jwtsecret` flag to configure the secret. Use their documentation [here](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon#authentication-api).

## Initialize a beacon node (optional)

If you would like to initialize your beacon node with the basic files required to run on a testnet or mainnet before actually running the node (Especially useful for configuring a new testnet), you can run the following command:

```bash
./lodestar init --network $NETWORK_NAME
```

By default, Lodestar stores all configuration and chain data at the path `$XDG_DATA_HOME/lodestar/$NETWORK_NAME`.

## Run a beacon node

To start a Lodestar beacon run the command:

```bash
./lodestar beacon --network $NETWORK_NAME
```

This will assume an eth1 client is available at the default location of `localhost:8545`.

In case eth1 clients are available at different locations, use `--eth1.providerUrls` to specify these locations in the command:

```bash
./lodestar beacon --network $NETWORK_NAME --eth1.providerUrls eth1.url1 eth1.url2
```

It is also possible to start a Lodestar beacon that does not follow the eth1 chain. For this, use the `eth1.enabled` option in the command:

```bash
./lodestar beacon --eth1.enabled false --network $NETWORK_NAME
```

Immediately you should see confirmation that the node has started

!!! info
    If your node is stuck with `Searching for peers` review your network configuration to make sure your ports are open.

A young testnet should take a few hours to sync. If you see multiple or consistent errors in the logs, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/new) or reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/yjyvFRP). Just by reporting anomalities you are helping accelerate the progress of Ethereum Consensus, thanks for contributing!

### Weak subjectivity

If you are starting your node from a blank db/genesis (or from last saved state in db) in a network which is now far ahead, your node is susceptible to "long range attacks."
[Read Vitalik's illuminating post on the same](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/).

If you have a synced beacon node available (e.g. your friend's node or an infrastructure provider) and a trusted checkpoint you can rely on, you can start off your beacon node in under a minute! And at the same time kicking the "long range attack" in its butt!

Just supply these **extra args** to your beacon node command:
```bash
--weakSubjectivitySyncLatest --weakSubjectivityServerUrl <synced node url> [--weakSubjectivityCheckpoint <trusted checkpoint in root:epoch format>]
```
In case you really trust `weakSubjectivityServerUrl` then you may skip providing `weakSubjectivityCheckpoint`, which will then result into your beacon node syncing and starting off a finalized state from the trusted url.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! warning
    Please use this option very carefully (and at your own risk), a malicious server URL can put you on the wrong chain with a danger of you losing your funds by social engineering. 
If possible, validate your `weakSubjectivityCheckpoint` from multiple places (e.g. different client distributions) or from other trusted sources. This will highly reduce the risk of starting off on a malicious chain.
