# Install from NPM [not recommended]

!!! danger
    For mainnet (production) usage, we only recommend installing with docker due to [NPM supply chain attacks](https://hackaday.com/2021/10/22/supply-chain-attack-npm-library-used-by-facebook-and-others-was-compromised/). Until a [safer installation method has been found](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/issues/3596), do not use this install method except for experimental purposes only.
