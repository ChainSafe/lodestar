## Lodestar Quickstart

In order to make things easy for users to onboard and try the ethereum **Proof of Stake** we have come up with  [Lodestar quickstart](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar-quickstart) scripts!

✅ Zero Configuration
✅ All testnets supported along with `mainnet`
✅ All mainstream Execution Clients integrated

With just single command you can run lodestar with various execution engines, switch them up to see the Optimistic sync work its magic and eventually brings lodestar and the execution engine in sync

### Customizations

You can adapt them to your production setups with ease! Here is a simple guide for you to follow along:

Happy to help! 🙏🙏🙏
