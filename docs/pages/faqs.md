# Frequently Asked Questions

This section of the documentation will cover common questions and encounters often asked by users and developers.

## Tooling

:::note "Package manager issues"

Lodestar relies on [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) and associated `packageManager` value to manage its package manager version.

Make sure `corepack` is correctly enabled if you encounter some package manager related issues:

```bash
corepack enable
```

## Troubleshooting Lodestar

### Running a beacon node

:::note "Heap memory limit"
Lodestar beacon node requires at least 8GB of heap space. While the `lodestar` script and the official docker image correctly sets the appropriate value, it might be necessary to manually set it for some specific scenario.

The simplest way to achieve this is via the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable or by passing [`--max-old-space-size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-old-space-sizesize-in-megabytes) directly to the node binary

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS: --max-old-space-size=8192
```

### Using Kubernetes

:::note "Unknown arguments error"
Lodestar reads all environment variables prefixed with `LODESTAR` and will try to parse
them similar to command line arguments, meaning any unknown argument will cause an error.

```
âœ– Unknown arguments: servicePort, servicePortEthConsensusP2p,
port9000Tcp, port9000TcpPort, port9000TcpProto, port9000TcpAddr, serviceHost
```

The extra arguments are present because Kubernetes automatically
[adds environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#environment-variables)
to the Pod based on the name (`metadata.name`) defined in the associated `Service`.
To resolve the issue, this name has to be changed to something that does not start with `lodestar`.
