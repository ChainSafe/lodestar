## Troubleshooting Lodestar

### Using Kubernetes
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
???+ note "Unknown arguments error on Kubernetes"
    Lodestar does not handle environment variables well when prefixed with `LODESTAR` by default. You may encounter issues such as:
    ```
    âœ– Unknown arguments: datadir, servicePort, servicePortEthConsensusP2p, 
    port9000Tcp, port9000TcpPort, port9000TcpProto, port9000TcpAddr, serviceHost
    ```
    The stateful set and other predefined environment variables should not use `LODESTAR`, which will break the deployment.
