<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
Lodestar does not handle environment variables well when prefixed with `LODESTAR` by default. You may encounter issues such as:
```
âœ– Unknown arguments: datadir, servicePort, servicePortEthConsensusP2p, 
port9000Tcp, port9000TcpPort, port9000TcpProto, port9000TcpAddr, serviceHost
```
The stateful set and other predefined environment variables should not use `LODESTAR`, which will break the deployment.
