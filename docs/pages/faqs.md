## Troubleshooting Lodestar

### Using Kubernetes
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
???+ note "Unknown arguments error on Kubernetes"
    Lodestar reads all environment variables prefixed with `LODESTAR` and will try to parse
    them similar to command line arguments, meaning any unknown argument will cause an error.
    ```
    âœ– Unknown arguments: servicePort, servicePortEthConsensusP2p,
    port9000Tcp, port9000TcpPort, port9000TcpProto, port9000TcpAddr, serviceHost
    ```
    The additional arguments are present because Kubernetes automatically creates environment
    variables based on the name (`metadata.name`) defined in the `StatefulSet` or `Deployment`.
    To resolve the issue, this name has to be changed to something that does not begin with `lodestar`.
