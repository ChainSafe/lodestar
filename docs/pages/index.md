### Execution Client

If you run the [execution client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#execution-clients) on the same host, you will need to check their requirements and add them to the above requirements. Broadly, to run both an execution and a consensus client on the same machine, we recommend a 4 TB SSD and 32 GB RAM.
