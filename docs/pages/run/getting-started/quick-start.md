title: Lodestar Quick Start Scripts
---

In order to make things easier and quicker for all types of users to bootstrap the Lodestar consensus client with a variety of execution clients, we have come up with [Lodestar Quickstart](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar-quickstart) Docker scripts!

- ✅ Zero configuration
- ✅ Single command startup
- ✅ All testnets supported along with mainnet
- ✅ All mainstream execution clients integrated

### Support

We actively maintain and update the configurations of running Lodestar with the most commonly used execution clients for various test/production networks so there is minimal configuration required for a standard setup.

If you have questions about these scripts, documentation or repository, feel free to talk to us on our [ChainSafe Discord](https://discord.gg/yjyvFRP) or [open an issue](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar-quickstart/issues/new) and a member of the team or our community will be happy to assist you.

### Customizations (Optional)

You can further adapt our Quickstart Docker scripts to your node setups with ease! Use our [Quickstart Custom Setup Guide](./quick-start-custom-guide.md)!
