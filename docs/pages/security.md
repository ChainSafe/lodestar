# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Lodestar currently undergoes a quick release cycle with regular minor releases published roughly fortnightly.
- :globe_with_meridians: We encourage using the [most recently released version](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/releases/latest) before reporting an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- :rotating_light: Please, send vulnerability reports to `security@chainsafe.io`.
- :warning: **Please do not file a public ticket** mentioning the vulnerability, as doing so could increase the likelihood of the vulnerability being used before a fix has been created, released and installed on the network.
