Lastly the <code>--reset</code> flag ensures the state is cleared on each restart - which is useful when testing locally.</p> <p>Once the node has started, make a request to <code>curl http://localhost:9596/eth/v1/node/identity</code> and copy the <code>enr</code> value.</p> <p>This would be used to connect from the second node.</p> <p>ENR stands for Ethereum node records, which is a format for conveying p2p connectivity information for Ethereum nodes.
