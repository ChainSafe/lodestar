# Easy script to join the merge devnet(s)
This is a setup to run and join the devnet with a single shell command. This script will pull the appropriate images and config and spin up the EL client and lodestar.

###### Requirements
1. docker
2. git
3. A bash shell

###### Just run the script with arguments
```bash
cd kintsugi/devnets
./setup.sh --dataDir kintsugi-data --elClient geth --devnetVars ./kintsugi.vars [--dockerWithSudo --withTerminal "gnome-terminal --disable-factory --"]
```

###### Example scenarios
1. Run with separate terminals launched & attached (best for testing in local) : 
`./setup.sh --dataDir kintsugi-data --elClient nethermind --devnetVars ./kintsugi.vars --withTerminal "gnome-terminal --disable-factory --" --dockerWithSudo `
2. Run *in-terminal* attached with logs interleaved (best for testing  in remote shell) : 
`./setup.sh --dataDir kintsugi-data --elClient nethermind --devnetVars ./kintsugi.vars --dockerWithSudo`
3. Run detached (best for leaving it to run, typically after testing 1 or 2): 
`./setup.sh --dataDir kintsugi-data --elClient nethermind --devnetVars ./kintsugi.vars --detached  --dockerWithSudo`

You can alternate between `geth` and `nethermind` to experiment with the ELs being out of sync ( and catching up) with `lodestar`.

###### Script parameters help
1. `dataDir`: Where you want the script and client's configuration data to be setup. Should be non-existent one for the first run. (The directory if already present will skip fetching the configuration, assuming it has done previously). You can also clean indivizual directories of CL/EL between the re-runs.
2. `elClient`: Which EL client you want, currently working with `geth` and `nethermind`
3. `devnetVars`: Contains the configuration specific to a devnet, like images, or urls for EL/CL to interact. Will be updated with new vars.
4. `dockerWithSudo`(optional): Provide this argument if your docker needs a sudo prefix
5. `--withTerminal`(optional): Provide the terminal command prefix for CL and EL processes to run in your favourite terminal. 
You may use an alias or a terminal launching script as long as it waits for the command it runs till ends and then closes.If not provided, it will launch the docker processes in *in-terminal* mode.
6. `--detached`(optional): By default the script will wait for processes and use user input (ctrl +c) to end the processes, however you can pass this option to skip this behavior and just return, for e.g. in case you just want to leave it running.

Only one of `--withTerminal` or `--detached` should be provided.
