5. Make a pull request! We review PRs on a regular basis.
6. You may be asked to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We make it relatively painless with CLA-bot.

# Lodestar Monorepo

We're currently experimenting with hosting the majority of lodestar packages and support packages in this repository as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). We're using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage the packages.
See [packages/](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar/tree/master/packages) for a list of packages hosted in this repo.

# Style Guide

- Functions and variables should be [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), classes should be [`PascalCase`](http://wiki.c2.com/?PascalCase), constants should be `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.
- Use `"` instead of `'`
- All functions should have types declared for all parameters and return value
- All interfaces should be prefixed with a `I`
  - eg: `IMyInterface`
- You probably shouldn't be using Typescript's `any`
- PRs should only update a single package (in our monorepo) at a time
- Private class properties need not be prefixed with a `_`
  - eg: `private dirty;`, not `private _dirty;`
- Many module class constructors have the following signature: `(options, modules)`
  - eg: `public constructor(opts: IExampleOptions, {db, logger}: IExampleModules)`
- Make sure your code is properly linted
  - run `yarn lint` from the command line and use an IDE that will help
- Make sure that your code is properly type checked: 
  - run `yarn check-types` from the command line and use an IDE that will help
- Make sure that the tests are still passing: 
  - run `yarn test:unit` from the command line
