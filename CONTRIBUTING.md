# Introduction

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Lodestar Chain. It's people like you that push the Ethereum ecosystem forward.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tests are all examples of helpful contributions that mean everyone can get started and start contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem.

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
> Unsure where to begin contributing to the Lodestar Chain? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
>1. Create your own fork of the code
>2. Do the changes in your fork
>3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Send a pull request.

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do PLEASE open an issue and email mikerah@chainsafe.io.

> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email Mikerah at mikerah@chainsafe.io.

### Tell your contributors how to file a bug report.
You can even include a template so people can just copy-paste (again, less work for you).

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of Nodejs are you using?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?
> General questions should go to the gitter room instead of the issue tracker.

# Code review process
> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. 

# Community
